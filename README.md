## Project Overview

This project is a modern, responsive task management application designed to organize and track tasks using a Kanban-style board. It provides a clear, intuitive interface for managing project workflows from initial ideation to completion. The application is built to be scalable and maintainable, leveraging a robust and popular technology stack.

## Key Features

  * **Kanban Board:** A three-column layout to visually manage tasks in `To Do`, `In Progress`, and `Done` states.
  * **Dynamic Task Management:** Users can add new tasks, edit existing task details (title and description), and permanently delete tasks.
  * **Interactive Progress Tracking:** Each task card features a real-time progress bar that automatically updates its value and color based on the task's status.
  * **Intuitive UI/UX:** Features include smooth drag-and-drop functionality for moving tasks, a persistent light/dark theme toggle, and a subtle hover-and-scale effect on task cards for enhanced user feedback.
  * **Scalable Architecture:** Built with a React Context API for centralized state management, ensuring a predictable data flow and easy-to-manage application state.
  * A 3D background behind the task list.
